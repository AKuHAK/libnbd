Explore if nbd_aio_notify_error is needed for faster response if
server goes away.

Bindings in other languages.
 - Latest attempt at adding Rust:
   https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2019-August/msg00416.html

Example code integrating with ppoll, pollfd, APR pollset (and others?).

Example command line utils to copy in/out (like qemu-img convert).

NBD_OPT_INFO mode (like qemu-nbd -L).

NBD resize extension.

NBD_INFO_BLOCK_SIZE.

TLS should properly shut down the session (calling gnutls_bye).

LIBNBD_TLS_ALLOW is not tested.  Related to this,
nbd_get_tls_negotiated is not tested.

Implement nbd_connect + systemd socket activation.

Improve function trace output so that:
 - Long strings are truncated.
 - Strings with non-printable characters are escaped.
 - Buffers are partially printed.
 - Lists of strings are printed.

Should we ship a "nbdcp" copying tool?
 - Could upload, download or copy between servers.
 - Duplicates functionality already available in qemu-img convert.

Suggested API improvements:
  general:
  - synchronous APIs that have a timeout or can be cancelled

  connecting:
  - nbd_connect_tcp: allow control over whether IPv4 or IPv6 is desired
  - nbd_connect_uri: allow control over which features are enabled
  - nbd_connect_command: allow passing char **env
  - connection completed callback

  TLS:
  - should be individual APIs for setting each TLS file
    (set_tls_certificates can continue to exist)
  - TLS should have a way to pass in PIN or password to
    support encrypted keys
  - allow use of TLS memory APIs (gnutls_datum_t + gnutls_*_mem)
  - support PKCS11 URIs (RFC 7512)

  Easier server implementation testing:
  - a way to force NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME over NBD_OPT_GO
  - a way to forcefully violate protocol (such as allowing writes to a
    readonly connection, or sending a request that exceeds bounds) for
    testing server reactions
