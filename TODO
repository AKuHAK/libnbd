Implement nbd_connect + systemd socket activation.

PHASES of the connection:
 - created

Bindings in other languages.

Example code integrating with glib2, APR pollset (and others?).

Example command line utils to copy in/out (like qemu-img convert).

Old-style protocol.

NBD_OPT_INFO mode (like qemu-nbd -L).

NBD resize extension.

NBD_INFO_BLOCK_SIZE.

NBD_CMD_CACHE.

TLS should properly shut down the session (calling gnutls_bye).
