NBD client library in userspace

To build from git:

  autoreconf -i
  ./generator/generator
  ./configure
  make

Requirements:

 * Probably only a C compiler is required.

Optional:

 * ocaml is required to run the generator, which is needed for
   building from git.  However it is not needed if building from
   tarballs, so this is classified as an optional dependency.

 * The nbdkit command, nbdkit-sh-plugin and nbdkit development headers
   are recommended as they are needed to run the test suite.
