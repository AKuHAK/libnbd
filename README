NBD client library in userspace

To build from git:

  autoreconf -i
  ./generator/generator
  ./configure
  make
  make check
  make check-valgrind  # optionally

Requirements:

 * Probably only a C compiler is required.

Optional:

 * GnuTLS is recommended for TLS support.  If not available then TLS
   support will be disabled in the library.

 * ocaml is required to run the generator, which is needed for
   building from git.  However it is not needed if building from
   tarballs, so this is classified as an optional dependency.

 * The nbdkit command, nbdkit-sh-plugin and nbdkit development headers
   are recommended as they are needed to run the test suite.

 * nbd-server and qemu-nbd if you want to do interoperability testing
   against these servers.

 * Perl Pod::Man and Pod::Simple to generate the documentation.

 * Python >= 3.3 to build the Python 3 bindings and NBD shell (nbdsh).

 * psktool and certtool (part of GnuTLS) for testing TLS support.

 * valgrind if you want to run the tests under valgrind.
