=head1 DESCRIPTION

nbdcopy copies to and from an NBD server.  It can upload a local file
to an NBD server, or download the contents of an NBD server to a local
file, device or stdin/stdout.  It can also copy between NBD servers.

The local file can be a file, a block device (eg. C</dev/cdrom>), or
C<-> which means stream in from stdin or stream out to stdout.  The
NBD server is specified using an NBD URI (like C<nbd://localhost>).
The NBD server can be local or remote, and encryption can be used if
libnbd was built with encryption support.

For more complex copying operations including converting between disk
formats use C<qemu-img convert>, see L<qemu-img(1)>.
